# Welcome to Guillem Juanico's portfolio!
First of all, I would like to thank you for using your time to check this repository. Let's talk a little bit about myself.

## About myself


## About my education
I have just finished studying my bachelor's degree in Mathematics at Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona which I have enjoyed a lot. During these last years, I have had the opportunity to learn about several mathematical theories and techniques. However, the degree does not limit to this kind of knowledge. It is well-known that mathematics are an analytical, abstract, logical subject. This is not a coincidence. 

Because of its nature, mathematics are the discipline that relates the most to what we understand as pure analytical thinking. Working in such general environment provides very useful tools that can be used not only in mathematical contexts but also in fields that lay further. It is true that the shade mathematics cast is very long, but I am not talking only about the technical results and propositions learned during the degree. Due to the fact that mathematics are problem-solving orientated, the logical methods and resources needed to solve complex problems that I have acquired during my education allow me to approach problems from any discipline in a creative, constructive, critical way, and with the right attitude, something that from my point of view is indispensable when facing challenges. 

Because of this, I am convinced that I will be a very valuable member in any position or team where logical thinking is needed and there are challenging problems that need to be solved.

## What to expect from this repository
In this repository, one can find Jupyter Notebook files related with Machine Learning, Deep learning and Data Science. The files are organised in folders. In order to take a look at the actual notebook, I would suggest double clicking the file to open it and, once one has accessed, open the file using GitHub
